### 1. Setting Up the GitHub Repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Initialize a Python project and set up a Dockerfile.

### 2. Dockerfile

- Write a Dockerfile that includes the necessary dependencies to read data from S3 and push it to RDS or Glue Database.
- Make sure to include Python dependencies and any necessary AWS SDKs.
- Build the Docker image and test it locally to ensure it works as expected.

### 3. Deploying to AWS ECR

- Set up AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) if you haven't already.
- Authenticate Docker with ECR and push the Docker image to your repository in ECR.

### 4. Lambda Function

- Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
- Choose "Container image" as the execution environment.
- Select the Docker image you pushed to ECR.
- Set up environment variables and permissions as needed.

### 5. Testing the Lambda Function

- Configure a test event in the Lambda console.
- Test the Lambda function with the event to ensure it behaves correctly.

### 6. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

- Set up a Jenkins pipeline that automates the deployment process.
- Use Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages including:
  - Building the Docker image.
  - Pushing the Docker image to AWS ECR.
  - Deploying the Lambda function.
  - Creating any necessary AWS resources using Terraform.
- Integrate GitHub webhook with Jenkins for automatic triggering of the pipeline.

### 7. Terraform

- Write Terraform code to create the required AWS resources like RDS instance, Glue Database, IAM roles, etc.
- Ensure that Terraform scripts are version controlled and included in the GitHub repository.

### 8. README.md

- Write a detailed README.md file in your GitHub repository explaining:
  - Overview of the project.
  - Instructions on setting up and running the Docker image locally.
  - Steps to deploy the Docker image to AWS ECR.
  - Instructions for setting up the Lambda function using the Docker image.
  - Details about the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and how to set it up.
  - Explanation of the Terraform scripts and how to use them to provision AWS resources.
